# Introduction 

Job types, job locations, rising demand for certain job categories, these are just some of the aspects of job hunting that many working people around the world are intrigued by. In this report, you will find an in depth analysis into the distribution of job listings across Australia. The report will analyze 3 main sections of job distribution within Australia, broken down by:

1) The change in demand by job category
2) The change in demand for jobs by city
3) The change in demand by job type

Our motivation to choose this as our research topic is prompted by experiencing first hand the cataclysmic effects of the coronavirus and the impact it has had on the job market globally. It has been an unfortunate scenario to witness unemployment rates skyrocket in major cities around the world. Thus, we want to visualize the changes in demand to jobs of all types and categories in Australia, particularly in the major cities.

# Dataset and Methodology
- Source of data. (Dewi)  
- Limitations (Hanh - master)  
- Methodology: How we deal with this dataset. ( Peimin - master)  

# Analysis:
### Clean the data: 
1. isolate the month + year (Hanh - master branch)  
```{r load-data, cache = TRUE}
raw_data <- read.csv(here::here("data", "seek_australia_sample.csv"))
```

```{r clean-data}
# choose the needed columns only
data_cleaned <- raw_data %>%
  select(3:9)

# separate the post-date column to get the date out
data_cleaned <- data_cleaned %>%
  separate (post_date, into = c("post_date", "tz"), sep = "T")

# convert the post_date column from character to date format
data_cleaned %>%
  mutate_at(vars(post_date), as.Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

2. Missing values  (Hanh - Hanh-Ngo branch)  

### Analyze the change in demand by job category) (Peimin-Peimin branch)


### Analyze the change in demand by city + life quality  
1. Change in demand (Hanh)    
2. How does it reflect life quality? (Dewi)

### Analyze the change in demand by job type

In this section, our goal is to see the different types of jobs such as full-time, part-time, contract and casual jobs. The changes in demand to these job types will vastly differ across the months, but it will be interesting to see which job type increased in demand.

```{r}
data_cleaned %>% group_by(job_type) %>% count() 
```

```{r}
data_cleaned %>% group_by(job_type) %>% count() %>% rename(`Job Type` = job_type,
                                                           `Number of jobs posted` = n) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = `Number of jobs posted`, y = `Job Type`, fill = `Job Type`)) +
      geom_col() +
      theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
